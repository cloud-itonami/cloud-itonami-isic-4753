# cloud-itonami-isic-4753

Open Business Blueprint for **ISIC Rev.4 4753**: retail sale of carpets,
rugs, wall and floor coverings in specialized stores -- a flooring
storefront (carpets, rugs, vinyl/laminate/hardwood flooring, wallpaper
and related coverings) selling and coordinating installation of these
specialized goods.

This repository publishes a flooring-retail
operations-COORDINATION actor -- sales/inventory/return transaction
logging, installation/delivery scheduling, flooring-material supply-order
coordination with registered vendors, and quality-concern flagging -- as
an OSS business that any qualified operator can fork, deploy, run,
improve and sell, so an independent flooring/carpet store never
surrenders its operations data to a closed back-office SaaS.

Built on this workspace's
[`langgraph`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/langgraph)
StateGraph runtime (portable `.cljc`, supervised superstep loop,
interrupts, in-mem/Datomic checkpoints) -- the same actor pattern as
every prior actor in this fleet -- here it is **FlooringRetailAdvisor
⊣ FlooringRetailGovernor**. This blueprint's own
`:itonami.blueprint/governor` keyword, `:flooring-retail-governor`, is a
distinct, independent build (no naming-collision precedent question --
distinct from sibling ISIC 47xx governors such as ISIC 4719's own
`:merchandise-retail-governor`).

> **Why an actor layer at all?** An LLM is great at drafting a sales-
> record summary, an installation-scheduling proposal, or a supply-order
> request -- but it has no license to actually finalize a
> quality-dispute resolution against a customer (a refund, a warranty
> decision, a liability determination), no way to independently confirm
> a store or a supply-order vendor is actually a registered/verified
> counterparty, and no notion of when a "flag this concern" op quietly
> turns into a claim to have already resolved it. Letting it act
> directly invites an unverified store's data entering the ledger, an
> unverified vendor receiving a merchandise order, or -- worst of all --
> a fabricated claim to have already issued a refund or approved a
> warranty claim over a defective-material or bad-installation dispute,
> exposing the shop to real liability. This project seals the
> FlooringRetailAdvisor into a single node and wraps it with an
> independent **FlooringRetailGovernor**, a human **approval workflow**,
> and an immutable **audit ledger**.

## Scope: coordination only, not dispute resolution

This actor is **operations coordination only**. It never performs or
authorizes:

- setting or overriding a shelf/unit price
- directly finalizing a quality-dispute resolution (issuing a refund,
  approving or denying a warranty claim, determining final liability for
  a defective-material or bad-installation dispute)
- quality-dispute-authority enforcement (instructing a store to pay out a
  settlement, closing out an installation-dispute case)

The governor's `scope-exclusion-violations` check re-scans every
proposal for this failure mode independently of the advisor's own
framing, and treats it as a HARD, permanent block regardless of
confidence or how clean everything else is. Flagging a quality concern
for a human to triage is exactly this actor's job --
`:flag-quality-concern` is never excluded by this check, only
FINALIZING/resolving/adjudicating that concern is.

### Actuation

**Every proposal this actor generates is `:effect :propose`, never a
direct actuation.** Two independent layers enforce this
(`flooringops.governor`'s `effect-not-propose-violations` HARD check and
`flooringops.phase`'s phase table, which never puts
`:flag-quality-concern` in any phase's `:auto` set). A human store
operator/flooring-quality coordinator is always the one who actually acts
on a flagged concern or confirms a high-cost supply order.

## The core contract

          ▼
      human approval
```

**The FlooringRetailAdvisor never commits a proposal the
FlooringRetailGovernor would reject, and a quality-concern flag or a
high-cost supply order never commits without a human sign-off.** Hard
violations (an unregistered/unverified store; an unregistered/unverified
supply-order vendor; a non-`:propose` effect; content touching
quality-dispute-resolution finalization; an op outside the closed
allowlist) force **hold** and *cannot* be approved past.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot
may perform physical domain work** (here: shelfing, rolling/carrying
carpet stock, point-of-sale handling) under human/robot floor operations
gated by store policy. This actor itself does not dispatch robot/hardware
actions -- it is strictly the operations-coordination layer
(sales-record logging, installation-operation scheduling, supply-order
coordination, quality-concern flagging) any physical-dispatch layer could
eventually feed proposals into, always gated the same way by the
independent FlooringRetailGovernor.

## Features

- **Closed proposal-op allowlist**: `log-sales-record`,
  `schedule-installation-operation`, `coordinate-supply-order`,
  `flag-quality-concern` (all `:effect :propose`).
- **Four HARD governor checks** (permanent, un-overridable):
  1. **Store unverified** -- the target store's business registration
     must exist AND be independently registered/verified in the store.
  2. **Vendor unverified** -- for `:coordinate-supply-order` only, the
     named vendor must exist AND be independently registered/verified --
     a supply-chain counterparty-verification gate mirroring the sibling
     47xx retail-coordination actors.
  3. **Effect is :propose** -- any other `:effect` value is rejected.
  4. **Scope exclusion** -- directly finalizing a quality-dispute
     resolution (issuing a refund, approving/denying a warranty claim,
     determining final liability for a defective-material or
     bad-installation dispute) and an op outside the closed allowlist are
     both permanently blocked.
- **Two ESCALATE (SOFT) gates**, either forces human sign-off:
  - `:flag-quality-concern` -- ALWAYS escalates, regardless of confidence
    or phase. A "flag a concern" op is never auto-commit eligible and
    never finalizes a quality-dispute-resolution decision itself -- it
    only surfaces the concern for a human.
  - `:coordinate-supply-order` above a cost threshold -- a large-value
    procurement proposal always needs a human sign-off.
  - (LLM confidence below the floor also escalates, as with every
    sibling actor.)
- **Staged rollout** (Phase 0→3):
  - Phase 0: read-only
  - Phase 1: sales-record logging only (approval-gated)
  - Phase 2: + installation-operation scheduling, supply-order proposals
    (approval-gated)
  - Phase 3: auto-commits clean, high-confidence, low-cost proposals
    (quality concerns and high-cost supply orders always escalate)
- **Append-only audit ledger** -- every decision is an immutable log
  entry.
- **langgraph-clj StateGraph** -- one request = one supervised run;
  human-in-the-loop via `interrupt-before`.

## Capability layer

This blueprint resolves its technology stack via
[`kotoba-lang/industry`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/industry) (ISIC
`4753`).

## Business-process coverage (honest)

| Covered | Not covered (out of scope for this R0) |
|---|---|
| Sales/inventory/return transaction logging (`:log-sales-record`) | Real POS/inventory-system integration |
| Installation/delivery scheduling coordination (`:schedule-installation-operation`) | Direct installer time-clock/payroll integration |
| Flooring-material supply-order coordination with a registered, verified vendor, HARD-gated on vendor verification and a double-actuation-free single-proposal shape (`:coordinate-supply-order`) | Real supplier-ordering-system integration |
| Quality-concern flagging (defective material, failed/disputed installation), ALWAYS human-gated (`:flag-quality-concern`) | Directly finalizing any quality-dispute resolution (refund, warranty decision, liability determination) -- permanently out of scope, not a gap |
| Immutable audit ledger for every log/schedule/order/flag decision | Daily reconciliation/cash-up -- a follow-up slice, not in this R0 |

Extending coverage is additive: add the next op (e.g. a
return-authorization or a cash-discrepancy-escalation check) as its own
governed op with its own HARD checks and tests, following the SAME "an
independent governor re-verifies against the actor's own records before
any real-world act" pattern this repo's flagship checks already
establish.

## Maturity

`:implemented` -- `FlooringRetailAdvisor` + `FlooringRetailGovernor` run
as real, tested code (see `Development` above), following the SAME
governed-actor architecture as every prior actor across this fleet, with
its own distinct, independently-named governor and its own
quality-dispute-resolution scope exclusion.

Code and implementation templates are AGPL-3.0-or-later.
